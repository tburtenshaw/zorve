**ZORVE** is a program that allows you to edit the information that Zinwell and Olevia record to their PVRs.

Zinwell and Olevia set-top-boxes can be used to record TV onto an external hard-drive. Olevia lets you do this out of the box, and you can easily get this functionality on a New Zealand Zinwell/DSE 620HD box. (See [Installing Olevia firmware onto a Zinwell set-top box](http://code.google.com/p/zimview/wiki/InstallingOleviaFirmwareOnZinwellSetTopBox).) These files are often labelled incorrectly, and their description pages can be truncated or completely empty.

## What can this software do now? ##
  * Browse the files and names of programs that your 620HD has recorded.
  * Edit the title and description of the programs.
  * Take a look at our [User Manual](UsingZorve.md) to use ZORVE to its fullest.

## What do we intend to do? ##
  * Provide easy ability to back up recorded television.
  * Fix internal discrepancies within the recorded files.
  * View frames of the recorded video.
  * Crop the beginning and end (or even split) recorded video.
  * Remove unwanted data such as subtitles, blank transport packets, to save space on your HDD.
  * Clip out advertisements.
  * Export to DivX, DVD, or other format.
  * Integrate within a networked Zinwell/Olevia set-top box.

## How to help ##
I have written some of what I know about the recording process on my [ZimView](http://code.google.com/p/zimview/) website.

Unfortunately these pages can't be directly edited, but I would be happy to be contacted by email if you know about this stuff.
  * [RecordedVideo](http://code.google.com/p/zimview/wiki/RecordedVideo) - more about the nature of how Olevia records and how it manages two partitions.
  * [InformationFile4096](http://code.google.com/p/zimview/wiki/InformationFile4096) - the 4096 byte files that Olevia creates - why do they double up on much of the information? How is it used by the machine?
  * [MpegNavigationFile](http://code.google.com/p/zimview/wiki/MpegNavigationFile) - these files contain much data that I don't know how it's used.
  * [MpegTransportStream](http://code.google.com/p/zimview/wiki/MpegTransportStream) - specifically how Olevia uses the MPEG-TS.

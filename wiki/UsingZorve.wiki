= Introduction =

*ZORVE* is a program designed to allow you to edit the information that your Zinwell or Olevia set-top box records to your hard-drive.

If you are not familiar with using Olevia firmware to record then take a look at my other website page: [http://code.google.com/p/zimview/wiki/UsingAndRecordingWithOleviaFirmware Using and Recording with Olevia Firmware].

You will need operating system access to the hard-drive that you have recorded to. You may be using a _FAT32_ drive or using an _ext3_ driver with Windows.

= Viewing recorded programs =
When the program starts it will default to its current directory.

Go to _File-Open_ and browse to the _!Record_Video_ directory. Choose one of the files (they will be of a form similar to 2010Z0227_1900_0.

ZORVE will read all through all the relevant files in this directory and display their title, the time and date of recording, and an approximate length.
